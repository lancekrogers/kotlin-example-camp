description: Create and run lightweight standalone `WORKFLOW.md` loops with `fest create workflow`, `fest next`, and `fest workflow advance`. Use when a user wants step-by-step workflow guidance inside any ordinary directory, explore/design work item, project folder, or thin-start workflow.

# Fest Standalone Workflows

Use standalone `WORKFLOW.md` when work needs a guided step loop in an ordinary
directory.

This is the thin-start path:

```text
WORKFLOW.md -> fest next -> do step -> fest workflow advance -> repeat
```

## Create

Run from the directory that should own the workflow:

```bash
mkdir -p workflow/explore/my-workflow
cd workflow/explore/my-workflow

fest create workflow my-workflow --no-init --steps '{
  "title": "My Workflow",
  "description": "A lightweight guided loop.",
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "PLAN",
      "goal": "Decide what needs to happen.",
      "actions": ["Write the goal.", "List the unknowns."],
      "checkpoint": "none"
    },
    {
      "name": "DO",
      "goal": "Do the work.",
      "actions": ["Make the change.", "Validate it."],
      "checkpoint": "verification"
    }
  ]
}'

fest next
```

For the current standalone first-run flow, include `--no-init` before running
`fest next`.

For human interactive creation, run the command without `--steps` from a TTY:

```bash
fest create workflow my-workflow --no-init
```

It prompts for title, intent, and step lines in `Name|Goal` form.

## Step JSON Contract

Workflow-level fields:

- `title` (required)
- `description` (optional)
- `steps` (required, non-empty)

Each step needs:

- `name`
- `goal`

Useful optional step fields:

- `actions`
- `output`
- `checkpoint`

Valid checkpoint values:

- `none`
- `verification`
- `documentation`
- `approval_required`

## Execution Loop

```bash
fest next
# do the visible step
fest workflow advance
fest next
```

## Common Mistakes

- Passing `--path` for standalone workflow creation. In standalone mode, run
  the command from the target directory; `--path` is for festival phase targets.
- Using `title` inside each step. Step objects require `name` and `goal`.
- Omitting `--no-init` in the current standalone first-run flow and expecting
  immediate `fest next` behavior.
