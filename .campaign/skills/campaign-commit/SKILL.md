# Camp Commit Decision

A camp was previously called a campaign; this skill applies whichever word the user uses.

## Decision

- Project change (submodule, linked project, or worktree): `camp p commit -m "msg"`
- Festival task execution: `fest commit -m "msg"`
- Camp root files: `camp commit -m "msg"` (stages all root-level changes; submodule refs excluded by default)
- Camp root, scoped to specific paths: `git add <paths>` then `camp commit --all=false -m "msg"` (commits only what is staged)
- Intentional root pointer sync: `camp refs-sync [submodule...]`

## Rules

- Never run raw `git commit` anywhere in a camp; staging with `git add` is fine.
- Keep submodule commits and root pointer sync as separate, explicit actions.
- Do not add agent co-author trailers unless explicitly requested.
- Do not bypass hooks with `--no-verify` without clear justification.
