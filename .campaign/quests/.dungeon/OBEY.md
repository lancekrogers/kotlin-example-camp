# Dungeon

Holding area for work that's finished, archived, or deferred.

## Camp Contract

This `OBEY.md` marks `dungeon/` as a camp-managed directory, not optional
scratch space. Use it as the stable archive and deprioritization area for the
current scope.

## Purpose

The dungeon contains three categories of "done" work:

- **completed/** - Successfully finished work
- **archived/** - Preserved for history, truly done
- **someday/** - Deprioritized but might revisit

Items moved into these status directories are organized into `YYYY-MM-DD/`
subdirectories so humans and agents can see when work was moved there.

## Structure

```
dungeon/
├── OBEY.md           # This file
├── completed/        # Completed work, bucketed by move date
├── archived/         # Historical archive, bucketed by move date
└── someday/          # Deferred work, bucketed by move date
```

## Workflow

### Finishing Work

Move completed work into `dungeon/completed/YYYY-MM-DD/`.
Move superseded or historical work into `dungeon/archived/YYYY-MM-DD/`.

### Deferring Work

Move work you may revisit later into `dungeon/someday/YYYY-MM-DD/`.

## Reviewing Items

Run the interactive crawl to review dungeon contents:
```bash
camp dungeon crawl
```

## Best Practices

1. **completed/** - For work you completed
2. **archived/** - For true history and superseded work
3. **someday/** - For work you intentionally deferred
4. Review periodically with `camp dungeon crawl`
