# Ingest Phase Gate

This gate verifies the ingest phase achieved its goal and produced approved structured output.

## Before you submit any step below

Whether the judge can open your repositories depends on its provider:
CLI-backed judges read the declared working directories themselves, while
judges without tool access see only what this phase wrote down. Writing the
essentials here keeps the gate independent of which judge you drew, and leaves
the festival a durable record after the worktree is gone.

Write the phase's evidence into `output_specs/` before submitting the first
step. These are picked up automatically; you do not need to list them:

| File | What belongs in it |
| --- | --- |
| `output_specs/requirements.md` | each required outcome from PHASE_GOAL.md, with the raw command output that verifies it |
| `output_specs/context.md` | where the work landed: commits, PRs, branches, build provenance |
| `output_specs/constraints.md` | each quality standard, with its proof |
| `output_specs/PRESENTATION.md` | the summary, and anything that needs a human decision |

Paste real terminal output, not summaries of it. "All tests pass" is an
assertion; the test run is evidence. A gate that rejects for missing evidence is
usually correct, and the fix is to attach the artifact rather than to re-run the
judge.

Only add an `**Evidence:**` list to a step when you want to name files beyond
these. Every path in such a list must exist and be non-empty or the step blocks
before the judge runs, which is why the conventional files above are left
implicit.

## Step 1: PHASE GOAL - Verify Goal Achievement

**Question:** Does the structured output capture the user's intent as specified in the ingest objective?

**Actions:**
1. Re-read PHASE_GOAL.md and compare stated ingest objectives against produced output
2. Verify the structured output faithfully represents the original input meaning
3. Confirm interpretive decisions are documented and justified

**Checkpoint class:** artifact_review

**Checkpoint:** APPROVAL REQUIRED - Confirm ingest goal is met

---

## Step 2: COMPLETENESS - Verify All Inputs Processed

**Question:** Were all input specifications processed?

**Actions:**
1. Confirm every file in `input_specs/` was read completely
2. Verify no inputs were overlooked or partially processed
3. Check that ambiguities and questions were noted

**Checkpoint class:** artifact_review

**Checkpoint:** APPROVAL REQUIRED - Confirm all inputs processed

---

## Step 3: APPROVAL - Verify User Validated Output

**Question:** Did the user validate the structured output?

**Actions:**
1. Confirm the user reviewed and approved the output specifications
2. Verify any user corrections were incorporated
3. Check that requirements are clear enough for downstream planning

**Checkpoint class:** operator_attestation

**Checkpoint:** APPROVAL REQUIRED - Confirm user validated output
