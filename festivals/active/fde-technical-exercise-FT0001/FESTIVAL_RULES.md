# Festival Rules: fde-technical-exercise

## Purpose

This document defines the principles, standards, and practices that all workers
must follow throughout this festival. Reference these rules before starting any
task and during task execution to ensure consistent quality.

## Engineering Excellence

### Code Quality

- **Prefer Refactoring Over Rewriting**: Only rewrite code when it's
  fundamentally flawed or unmaintainable
- **Follow Existing Patterns**: Study and follow established patterns in the
  codebase before introducing new ones
- **Apply SOLID Principles**:
  - Single Responsibility: Each class/function should have one reason to change
  - Open/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification
  - Liskov Substitution: Derived classes must be substitutable for base classes
  - Interface Segregation: Many specific interfaces are better than one general
    interface
  - Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Design Principles

- **KISS (Keep It Simple)**: Choose simple solutions over complex ones
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Don't add functionality until it's
  needed
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Eliminate duplication through abstraction
- **Composition Over Inheritance**: Prefer composition for code reuse

### Code Organization

- Functions should be under 50 lines
- Files should be under 500 lines
- Classes should have a single, well-defined purpose
- Use dependency injection instead of global state
- Separate concerns into distinct modules

## Quality Standards

### Testing Requirements

- [ ] Write tests for all new functionality
- [ ] Maintain or improve existing code coverage
- [ ] Include unit tests for business logic
- [ ] Add integration tests for system boundaries
- [ ] Test error cases before happy paths
- [ ] Include tests for edge cases

### Code Review Checklist

- [ ] Code follows language conventions and style guide
- [ ] No commented-out code or debug statements
- [ ] Clear, self-documenting variable and function names
- [ ] Appropriate error handling with context
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities introduced
- [ ] Performance implications considered

### Documentation Standards

- [ ] Update documentation alongside code changes
- [ ] Include clear commit messages explaining "why" not just "what"
- [ ] Document architectural decisions and trade-offs
- [ ] Add inline comments only for complex algorithms
- [ ] Update API documentation for interface changes
- [ ] Include examples in documentation where helpful

## Development Process

### Task and Sequence Numbering

- **Sequential Execution**: Both sequences and tasks must be prepended with
  numbers when they must be completed in order (e.g., `1_task_name.md`,
  `2_task_name.md`)
- **Parallel Tasks**: Tasks within a sequence that can be worked on in parallel
  may use the same number (e.g., `1_task_a.md`, `1_task_b.md`, `1_task_c.md`)
- **Verification Workflow**: Every sequence must include:
  - `N_testing_and_verify.md` - Testing and verification task (where N is the
    next number after implementation tasks)
  - `N+1_code_review.md` - Code review task
  - `N+2_review_results_update_tasks_iterate_if_needed.md` - Final review and
    iteration task
- **Results Directory**: Testing results and code review documents must be
  placed in a `results/` subdirectory within the sequence directory

### Before Starting a Task

1. Read and understand the task requirements completely
2. Review relevant existing code and documentation
3. Identify dependencies and potential impacts
4. Plan your approach before coding
5. Check if similar functionality exists to reuse
6. Note the task number to understand execution order and dependencies

### During Development

- Create small, focused commits with clear messages
- Run tests frequently during development
- Use version control effectively (branch, commit, push)
- Keep pull requests focused on a single logical change
- Refactor as you go to maintain code quality

### Before Marking Complete

- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] Linters and formatters have been run
- [ ] Type checking passes (if applicable)
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Code has been self-reviewed
- [ ] Security implications considered
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained (unless approved to break)

## Decision Making

### When to Escalate

- Breaking changes to public APIs
- Significant architectural decisions
- Security-related changes
- Performance trade-offs
- Introduction of new dependencies
- Deviation from established patterns

### Technical Debt

- Document technical debt when created
- Include TODO comments with issue numbers
- Prefer incremental improvements over big rewrites
- Balance perfection with delivery

## Security Principles

- Never commit secrets, keys, or credentials
- Validate all inputs
- Sanitize all outputs
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Consider security implications in all changes
- Keep dependencies up to date

## Performance Guidelines

- Measure before optimizing
- Profile to find actual bottlenecks
- Consider algorithmic improvements before micro-optimizations
- Cache expensive operations appropriately
- Be mindful of memory usage
- Consider scalability implications

## Collaboration

- Communicate blockers early
- Ask for help when stuck for more than 30 minutes
- Share knowledge through documentation
- Be open to feedback and suggestions
- Help team members when they need assistance

## Festival-Specific Rules

- **Docker only.** Build, test and run through the `just` modules (`just build gradle`, `just test all`, `just test jdk 21`, `just build matrix`, `just gate`). Never invoke Gradle or a JDK on the host (C7).
- **Commits.** Use `fest commit` while executing this festival; never raw `git commit`. No AI co-author trailers or attribution in commits or PRs (C6).
- **PRs.** Open with `gh pr create --repo lancekrogers/kotlin-ktor-realworld-example-app --base master`; a fork otherwise targets upstream. Merge only when JDK 17 and 21 are both green (D012).
- **Outward actions need authorization.** Pushing, opening PRs, merging, and changing GitHub settings happen only when the user has authorized execution.
- **No author data leaks.** Every endpoint returning an article or comment gets a raw-JSON test proving no `password`, `email` or `token` under `author` (D008).
- **Test isolation.** Rows persist across test methods. Tests create uniquely named data and assert only on rows they created; never assume an empty database (D009).
- **No silent skips.** Tests left disabled carry an `@Ignore` reason. Record `just test census` in the sequence `results/` (D010).
- **Route order.** Public reads go in `authenticate(optional = true)` registered before the mandatory `authenticate` block, with a test pinning it (D003).
- **Evidence as you go.** Record commands and their raw output, agent missteps, and verification in the sequence `results/` when they happen. `AGENT_WORKLOG.md` is written from these records, not from memory (C8).
- **Unverified claims.** When a task depends on something marked unverified (LOWER on CLOB, H2 GROUP BY, test row persistence, the zero-run cause), prove it first; if it fails, stop and amend the owning decision.
