## Camp: amex

This is the AI agent instruction file for the amex camp.

## Overview

<!-- Describe what this camp is about -->

## Projects

<!-- List and describe your projects -->

## Development Guidelines

<!-- Add coding standards, patterns, etc. -->

## Directory Structure

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| projects/ | Git submodules and project repositories |
| projects/worktrees/ | Git worktrees for parallel development |
| docs/ | Human-authored documentation |
| dungeon/ | Archived, deprioritized, or paused work |
| festivals/ | Festival methodology planning (via fest CLI) |
| workflow/ | Workflow artifacts |
| workflow/reviews/ | Review notes, feedback, and assessments |
| workflow/design/ | Design documents and specifications |
| workflow/explore/ | Exploratory research and discovery notes |
| .campaign/intents/ | System-managed intent state used by `camp intent` |

## Navigation Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Directory |
|----------|-----------|
| `cgo p` | projects/ |
| `cgo wt` | projects/worktrees/ |
| `cgo w` | workflow/ |
| `cgo f` | festivals/ |

## AI Instructions

These defaults apply until this camp overrides them. Add your own below.

### Sizing work

Say which gear you are in before creating anything:

- One file, one session, reversible: answer in chat, create nothing.
- Linear, a handful of steps: `fest create workflow <name>`.
- Multi-phase, multi-repo, or outlives a session: `fest create festival`.

Most requests are the first row. Reaching for a festival on small work is a
failure mode, not thoroughness.

### Planning a festival

Create it, then drive `fest next` and answer what it asks. Do not scaffold every
phase and sequence up front and fill the `[REPLACE]` markers afterward: it drops
`fest validate` to 0 and produces plausible filler instead of a plan. The loop is
the planning process.

Plan the full scope. Scaling down is the user's call, made against a complete
plan.

### Task documents

`fest validate` scores structure, not substance, so a festival of one-line tasks
still validates at 100. Write each task for an agent with none of this
conversation's context: name the files it touches, state error paths as well as
the happy path, and cite `file:line` anchors you have actually opened.

### Committing

Never run raw `git commit` in a camp.

- Executing a festival: `fest commit -m "..."`
- Inside `projects/*` or a worktree: `camp p commit -m "..."`
- Camp root files: `camp commit -m "..."`

### Capturing work

Use `camp intent` for fast capture and small actionable work, `workflow/design/`
for architecture or exploratory thinking, and festivals for structured
multi-step execution. Intent state lives under `.campaign/intents/`.

### Learning the methodology

`fest understand` covers it in full. Read topics when you need them rather than
all at once. Start with `fest understand planning` and `fest understand loop`.
