# Explore

Exploration, research, and prototype workspace.

## Purpose

`workflow/explore/` is for creating subdirectories that investigate a topic,
research an approach, or prototype something before you decide to implement it.

Use this directory when the work is still exploratory or decision-seeking.
When the direction becomes implementation-bound, promote the useful output into
`workflow/design/`, a festival, or another concrete execution path.

## What Goes Here

- Research into technologies, approaches, or tools
- Exploratory investigations and prototypes
- Strategic analysis and competitive research
- Architecture spikes and feasibility checks
- Codebase deep-dives and audits

## Relationship To Design

- `workflow/explore/` is for uncertainty, discovery, and experiments.
- `workflow/design/` is for work you actually plan to build.

An exploration can become a design once the unknowns are reduced enough to make
implementation decisions.

## Typical Structure

```
explore/
├── <topic>/           # Active explorations at root
└── dungeon/           # Pre-scaffolded local archive for finished or stale work
    ├── completed/
    ├── archived/
    └── someday/
```

## Guidelines

- Use one directory per topic, question, or prototype.
- Capture notes, experiments, and evidence that help a later design or festival.
- Promote stable, decision-ready outputs into `workflow/design`.
- Use `camp dungeon crawl` to keep completed or stale explorations organized.
