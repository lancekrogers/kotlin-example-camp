# Design

Implementation-bound design workspace.

## Purpose

`workflow/design/` is where humans and agents create one subdirectory per
feature, system, or product change that you actually expect to implement.

This is not a general documentation bucket. Use it to flesh out designs that
are likely to turn into implementation work, festivals, or active project specs.

## What Goes Here

- Feature design packages and implementation specs
- Architecture decisions tied to planned work
- UX flows, wireframes, APIs, and technical tradeoff notes
- Agent collaboration directories for iterating on a design

## When To Use Something Else

- Use `workflow/explore/` for research, spikes, prototypes, and comparisons
  when you are not yet committed to building something.
- Use `camp intent` for quick capture, rough notes, and ideas that do not
  deserve a design directory yet. Camp stores those items under
  `.campaign/intents/`.
- Use `festivals/` when the work needs a structured phase/sequence/task plan.

## Typical Structure

```
design/
├── <feature-or-system>/ # One directory per design effort
└── dungeon/             # Pre-scaffolded local archive for finished or stale work
    ├── completed/
    ├── archived/
    └── someday/
```

## Workflow

- Create a subdirectory when a design effort needs focused collaboration.
- Keep implementation-bound design material together instead of scattering it
  across general docs.
- Use `camp dungeon crawl` regularly to triage stale or finished design work.
